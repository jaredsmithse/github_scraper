github_scraper
==============

A scraper for github. This snippet of code will pull the search results for ruby developers in San Francisco and feed the usernames into the octokit gem to get their emails.

The original creation of this script was to help find potential mentors in the city for DevBootCamp, but has since been decommissioned.
